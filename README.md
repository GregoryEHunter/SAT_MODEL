## Data Downloading / generation / preprocessing

## training your baselines
Baseline training and extraction can be found in the baslines folder
## training your experiments
Training of the SAT model variant used in this paper and generation for evaluation can be found in the PaperSatTrainingAndGeneration folder. These model definitions can be found in the Model_definitions tab
## evaluating your model output (scoring, sampling, etc)
Automatic evaluation (including generation from the finetuned models and GPT-2 standard) can be found in the "Evaluation" folder. In the "Baselines" folder extraction of the real excerpts from the data can be found.
